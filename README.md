About

This project is an AI-powered ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Resume Analyzer built using Google Gemini, Streamlit, and PDF-to-image processing.

The application allows users to upload a resume in PDF format and compare it against a provided job description. The resume is converted into an image and analyzed using a multimodal Gemini LLM, enabling deep understanding of both textual and visual resume content. Based on the analysis, the system provides professional HR-style feedback, evaluates role suitability, and calculates a resume-to-job match percentage similar to real-world ATS systems.

Key features include:

Resume analysis using Gemini 2.5 Pro multimodal capabilities

Job description and resume comparison

ATS-style percentage match scoring

Identification of missing keywords

Strengths and weaknesses evaluation from an HR perspective

PDF-to-image processing for accurate resume understanding

Secure API key management using environment variables

Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

This project demonstrates practical application of multimodal LLMs in HR technology, recruitment automation, and career analytics, making it a strong addition to AI engineering portfolios and real-world AI product prototypes.
